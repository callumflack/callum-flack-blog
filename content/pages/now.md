Here's what I'm focussing on right now.

1.  Experimenting with a high-fat, no whole-grains diet. For years I've been tired and lacking daily energy. I'd never dieted before in my life, so this has been a significant new routine. After 6 weeks in, I certainly have more fuel to burn.

2.  Writing, writing, writing. I'm making an explicit effort to treat every opportunity to share ideas as a chance to write. Whether that's [twitter](https://twitter.com/callumflack), the [MindBodyAttention Slack channel](http://mindbodyattention.com/#MBA%20Slack), Michael Fogleman's [HostWriting](http://hostwriting.com/) or the [Build A Second Brain forum](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) (ask me about these things!), I'm trying to share what I've been thinking about by taking the time to think in writing.

3.  The writing focus has resulted in active participation in a number of excellent online forums where I feel connected to some terrific people. My original motto for Patternworks was "interesting things with interesting people" and I've found that with the [MindBodyAttention Slack channel](http://mindbodyattention.com/#MBA%20Slack) folks.

4.  After almost 3 years working for myself (and mostly by myself) as [Patternworks](https://patternworks.com.au/), I'm actively looking to join a great product team to work on a meaningful internet product.

<!-- * I continue to slowly work on [Album Registry](http://albumregistry.com/)â€”it's been a learning experience. I'm also very keen to work on a new version of [Sembl](http://sembl.net/) with Cath Styles and some new Sembl fans. -->
