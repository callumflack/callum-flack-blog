Hi, I'm Callum. I'm drawn to wonder. I use this blog as a practice space to reassemble the "things inbetween" that resonate with me. Often I won't understand the reasons why they resonate until I write, draw or play around with them.

I'm a designer by trade. I focus on digital design, working fluidly across visual design, user experience, and code. You can read more about the services I provide at <a target="_blank" href="https://callumflack.design">Callum Flack Design</a>.

I learned to code websites in 2010 so that I could gain more design control. This unexpectedly changed the way I viewed the world and transformed me into a constant learner.

<!-- Rough consensus and maximal interestingness -->

<!-- I think (and design) mostly in words, but I remember things—like 45 record labels—mostly in colours and images. -->

I've lived in and worked around in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, all for five years or more. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in <a class="icon-targetblan" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BXbsNdrAt-v">Cairns, Australia</a>.

<!-- Eventually, everything connects—people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se. — Charles Eames -->

<!-- “While I was there, I was just gathering images and names, and ideas and rhythms, and I was storing all of these things … in my mind somewhere. And when it was time to sit down and write songs, when I reached into the attic to see what I was gonna write about, that’s what was there. I just felt a strong passion toward the discovery of going there, and it opened my eyes, and all my senses were overwhelmed by the feeling of that place. When I sat down to write songs, that’s all I could think of…” — Robbie Robertson’s writing process -->

In my spare time, I collect vinyl records from every diaspora of recorded music. Finding the uncommon on forgotten records is a lesson in noticing wonder that I take with me everywhere. Some people even know me for the series of annual soul 45 mixes I used to do, called <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/coloronetear/">The Way I See It</a>.

Current maxim: _<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/callumflack/status/970509881034686465">optimise for interesting</a>_.
