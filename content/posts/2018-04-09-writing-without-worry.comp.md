title: Writing without worry
lede: How do you allow yourself to cultivate a habit? How does one just be curious without worrying about turning shit into gold? Define gold anyway? The surest method to cultivating a writing habit is to be OK writing “curious shit” in an oblique manners.

Habits are more effective than goals because once you start towards a goal, everything changes, including the goal. It’s hard to keep syncing real actions against an imaginary future. It’s more effective to focus on the habit of doing and allow daily outcomes to generate new information to act on.

Writing about this yesterday reminded me that a goal is similar to fate. They both assume a project (or story) with tasks (or a script), and an assumption that obtaining the goal (or getting to the end of the story) is merely a matter of following the tasks (or cues) in the right order. Fate should differ slightly because the cues are deemed by a supernatural power, and we depend on the strength of our faith in this supernatural power to should show us which cues are right. Sound curious? It does to me. Yet that scenario is not very different from what wrestling with goals feels like: every action creates a new possible outcome, and so the reality of your goal changes against what you understand it to be _every time you act_.

Goals are foggy, misleading, and error-prone. Every project will proceed with unexpected twists because of seemingly daemon-like forces that are, in fact, just our misunderstanding of reality. No wonder the myths of writing revolve around misery, resistance and fear.

[The Resistance](https://stevenpressfield.com/2013/11/resistance-and-self-loathing/) is a constant fearful belief that a final failure will occur that seals off all past failures to make the story of failure complete: "you never were going to write, and you didn't!". Every perfect morning gets scuppered by the first "gotcha" of reality, we cave at sight of the daemon, and our wasted positivity piles up into a mountainous testimony of failure. Why bother, whispers the damn monkey.

_It was my goal to write. Thus, it has been my fate to fail to write._

## Destroying fate (and outcome-based goals)

This tweet destroys the concept of fate in a beautifully simple line:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi. <br>Ergodicity takes the story out of history.</p>&mdash; Ole Peters (@ole_b_peters) <a href="https://twitter.com/ole_b_peters/status/891284580434575360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Ergodicity is a mathematical model for understanding that risk is dynamic, not static. This seems to say very simply that at each moment, anything that happens will change what happens next. So there's no story being played out, and Ole can prove it with maths.

Thing is, Rational Me doesn't need maths to know this. But he's not in charge all the time. Some back part of my monkey mind is obviously advocating against Rational Me, keeping aflame a belief system I'm hardly conscious of. Each of us are a society within.

<!-- _that duplicate black cat I just saw was not a glitch, I just experienced déjà vu_.  -->

So what's an ex-ape to do? Same thing as yesterday, I guess: override the monkey mind with mantras and cultivate habitual actions, not wishful goals.

<!-- Dig. Find gold. Present it as saviour. But we'll soon forget it. -->

## Cultivating habits by digging in shit

Writing daily is a habit I‘m cultivating. I hope this will allow me to just be curious without worrying about turning shit into gold. Which means you, dear reader, may have to put up with some shit. Perhaps the tagline of this blog should be “curious shit”?

The obvious metaphor here is that I'm tending to my writing garden by employing a healthy dose of, you guessed it, _manure_.
