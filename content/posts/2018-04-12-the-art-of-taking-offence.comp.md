My wife was offended when I ended yesterday's post with the mention of excrement hue. That immediately reminded me of two quotes I'd seen recently. So I made a "sembl doublequote" about the art of offence.

Sometimes being a little offensive is a good way to provoke insights. Laughter is, after all, a way we can poke at the unwritten rules of society.

"Sembl doublequotes" are an idea from [Charles Cameron](http://zenpundit.com/?p=51353). By creating a visual match of connected ideas, we can turn off language and logic, and instead access intuition and pattern-matching in order to finding new connections. And if you follow that link, you'll see how beautiful and fascinating they can be. I'll explain how I understand sembl doublequotes in a later post.
