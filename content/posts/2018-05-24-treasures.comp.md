Yesterday I was presented with a gift of treasures. They were brought to me as a token of goodwill and mutual interest by my son, who had carried them home in his pocket and then divided them between two yellow lids on the kitchen bench. He'd learned the practice of finding and carrying treasures from his sister. Their treasures are detritus, cheap and broken, found in gutters, gardens and playgrounds. But they are valuable to him: a pretence at being an adult with agency, someone who _owns_ things. Giving them to me was significant, proof of their value. At other times, trades will occur between him and his older sister, who is already good at both treasure finding and treasure dealing. Small bags or containers are found and used to hold the treasures. These treasure carriers are put under pillows, or in safe places near their beds. And maybe they become wishes, longings to be grown-up, when they can do anything they want.

These particular treasures sat on the bench for the rest of the afternoon, reminding me of this photograph of the contents from the pocket of Jasper Johns or Robert Rauschenberg. I don't know which guy because I can't find the picture. But I distinctly remember it. The older artist holding out his hand, in black and white, and in it was matches, buttons, a nail, a badge and rocks. Things like that. Little memory sparks. Little ways of noticing the world, and holding onto the memories. Tiny sacredness. Which I always found so impressive because I felt that the artist had done this for a long time, and had not let go this practise of looking from his childhood ways.

It strikes me that I have spent most of this blog so far talking about curiosity and the search for beauty. And I how I like to collect these wonders—a record, a graphic, a typeface, a phrase—and put them in a special place, a _wunderkammer_, where I _let it cure some_. And I didn't realise how long I've been doing this until my son gifted me his treasures yesterday.

<!-- Writing a blog means I have to remember things to write about. I can be struck by an a passing thought as I walk, but lose it as I open my office door, never to return. Holding on to odd tensions from these "inbetween" moments, and writing them out helps unpeel layers of taste, nehind which I sometimes glance sediment of identity. -->
