Walked by Project 84 the yesterday day. A campaign by male suicide prevention charity CALM with sculptures by Mark Jenkins, there are 84 sculptures of young men on the roof of the ITV building on the South Bank to highlight the 84 men that commit suicide each week.

It's a haunting piece of work. I'd read about before I saw it but I was still shocked when I saw it for real. The figures look like real people, dangerously close to the edge and your brain convinces you they are moving slightly. The quiet grey bank holiday added to the eerie atmosphere.

Putting it on the ITV building means it's got [good coverage on the channel](https://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/project-84-we-join-the-campaign-to-prevent-male-suicide) which seems a good use of ITV. I've donated to Calm, you can do so too here.
