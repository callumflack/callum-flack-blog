title: Hello, habit
lede: On how I will stop being "goal perfect" to the point of writing paralysis and instead aim for a daily habit of writing by blogging. Keep drafting until I get somewhere. I'll make it a habits, not a goal.

Since January 10 this year I've eaten almost nothing containing whole grains. This is the first time in my life I've ever dieted, and it's made a big positive impact on my daily energy. If I had made a deal with myself to merely reduce my whole grain intake, I doubt I'd have felt the difference enough to continue the habit change. Going cold turkey helped me trick my rational mind into playing long enough to feel the difference.

For years I've intuitively felt that writing should be a priority for both my personal and work thinking process. And yet I've always utterly failed to write. So I’ve decided the best way for me to write is to blog daily. I'll make it the coldest of turkeys I can manage. Whether I do that _every_ day is another matter. I probably won't. But so long as I'm flexing my habit muscles, _something_ will happen, rather than _nothing_.

Like [Scott Adams says](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847745), make it about “habits, not goals”:

> …goal-oriented people exist in a state of nearly continuous failure that they hope will be temporary. That feeling wears on you. In time, it becomes heavy and uncomfortable. It might even drive you out of the game… If you achieve your goal, you celebrate and feel terrific, but only until you realize you just lost the thing that gave you purpose and direction.

The only constant is change. If everything changes once we act, so does our goal. Sure, one needs a direction to follow but only enough to update the “X” on our map by stopping to notice where we are, where we've come from, and to find a good outcrop to get a view of the terrain we’re navigating. If you believe that the map is perfect and that “X” will lead directly to the goal, don't be surprised if you're swallowed up by the crevasse that shouldn’t be there.

But before we can even start to think about any map versus terrain arguments, we should be, at the very least, _walking_.

Choose a direction, start walking.
