I used to collect American soul records like a maniac, and I always assumed my collector journey would encompass _making a record myself_. This isn't a unique process. Many of my record nerd friends are artists who've released their own music.

Reflecting back on my thoughts about writing and blogging last week, I think I can see a series of steps that are prerequisites for creative work. (I haven't read or researched anything about this, I'm just thinking out loud and joining some dots).

The prerequisite steps begin with an individual's interest, are extended by sharing interests with others, and end with the creative process itself:

<!-- Fan > Collector > { Scenius / Band } > Emulation / Imitation / Copying > Creation -->

`Fan > Collector > Scene > Copying > Creation`

## Fan

Let me run through each step. First of all, you have to be a _fan_. That is, you have to be interested. Really interested, to the point of fascination. That's how I feel about [those old American soul 45s](https://youtu.be/0bEV-4xp5LA). I'm awestruck by them. They are mythical to me.

## Collector

At this point, it's natural to start _collecting_ more examples of this thing you're fascinated by. You become attuned to look for these examples, as one does when you learn the meaning of a new word and start seeing it everywhere. In this way, collecting is a form of _seeing_.

Here's Robbie Robertson, songwriter from The Band and Martin Scorcese's music producer, on his writing process:

> I was just gathering images and names, and ideas and rhythms, and I was storing all of these things … in my mind somewhere. And when it was time to sit down and write songs, when I reached into the attic to see what I was gonna write about, that’s what was there. I just felt a strong passion toward the discovery of going there, and it opened my eyes, and all my senses were overwhelmed by the feeling of that place. When I sat down to write songs, that’s all I could think of…

Only when you have a well to draw upon can you match and rearrange enough to make something new.

# Scenius

Then you'll probably have an urgent need to share your fascination with others who _get it_. That is, you will seek out a _scene_ of fellow collectors who share your enthusiasm. I used to frequent online record forums and many of the folks I've spoken to on those forums are still firm friends 15 years later. They send me soundfiles of hard-as-nails soul ballads, so I'm always in the know. That's scenius in action.

Example: The Rolling Stones began when the teenage Keith Richards [spotted the Chess records](http://www.wgbh.org/articles/Chess-Records-the-Chicago-Blues-and-the-Rolling-Stones-8055) that Mick Jagger was carrying under his arm.

<!-- I've tried to think of examples of completely new things happening without a scene. I can't. I'd say they're exceptions to the rule.  -->

I don't think this step needs to be interpersonal. The internet can allow a collector to create his own scenius to draw upon. Kenyan's World Champion javelin thrower, Julius Yego, is nicknamed "[Mr. YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Yego)" because he learned how to throw by watching YouTube.

# Imitation

Here's where fascination takes a leap. If you've got it bad, you'll start extending your fascination through imitation. You'll start to try and recreate what you've been collecting by yourself. Or possibly with others from your scenius, as happens when getting a band together.

Here's Marshall Chess describing The Rolling Stones' first Chess Records studio session brief:

> They wanted the Chess sound … to be exactly like the originals. But it came out like the Rolling Stones.

They're named after the Muddy Waters song, after all.

Imitation has a bad rep. When I was in school, "copying" was frowned upon. We're taught that being original is high status. But watching my daughter draw from books all and every day, it is very obvious to me that humans learn by imitation.

# Creation

Imitation repeated often enough quickly becomes distinguishable as something "new". This step is a whole process unto itself that begs for a greater scope of discussion, so I'm not going into that now.

The prerequisite that led to the creative work is still a key once you're knee deep in the creative work: _being interested_. If you like what you're making, it will give you the impetus to keep going until it becomes something new.

Another aspect of _keeping going_ during this work is to _be opinionated_. Many will offer advice but you've got to stick with your gut. No one can compete with you on being you, so it simply won't be as good as it can be without retaining your you-ness.

# Love what you steal

I think the unnoticed iceberg of the creative process is a series of prerequisite steps which start and continue with curiosity (aka being interested, fascinated), pushed along by the sharing that happens once you become so interested you can't help but continue.

As Bob Dylan says, all artistry is "love & theft". Love what you steal.
