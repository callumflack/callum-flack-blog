Ergodicity takes the story out of history.
Habits are more effective than goals because once you start along a path, everything changes, including your goal (Ole B Peters here). Better to be in process rather than debating "X" on a map.

It’s hard too keep updating your goal in accordance with your actions. It’s more effective to focus on the habit of doing and allow outcomes to take care of themselves.

Writing daily is the habit I‘m cultivating. I hope this will allow me to just be curious without worrying about turning shit into gold. Which means you, dear reader, may have to put up with some shit. Perhaps the Tagline of this blog should be “curious shit”?

Blogging this shit means I have an output. Notice that a goal is different from an output — I think an output is very important because you have something to show and talk about with other people. From here I can polish my shit.

Now why is it important to “show other people”? Let me condense Eno for you: every genius came from a scenius. Genius is an individual’s insight. But those insights don’t happen by themselves. There require a “scene”. Example: Kraftwerk is a product of the ill-named Krautrock scene. They were all members of other bands for years previously before their breakthrough sound emerged. So a genius requires a scene of mutually interested people co-operating in the evolution of ideas.

once again, it’s the mechanism/process that’s interests me, not the past-time labels (aka “goal”). The process yields. Labeling Goals do not.

I just want a good conversation. So I’ll start by talking to myself by writing daily. And if you feel obliged to chime in, even if just to say the colour of shit has changed, please do so.
