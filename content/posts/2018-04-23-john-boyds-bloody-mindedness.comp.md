title: John Boyd's bloody-mindedness
lede: Creativity may also demand another type of creative fuel—extreme disagreement, or bloody-mindedness. John Boyd's character is the perfect example.

My friend just texted to tell me enthusiastically he's just finished reading the Robert Coram biography of [John Boyd](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Boyd_(military_strategist)>). This reminded me that when I read the book, my biggest takeaway wasn't learning about the process that lead to Boyd's genius theories, it was instead his sheer bloody mindedness.

According to the book, Boyd was an extremely confrontational loud-mouth, and despite his supposedly self-professed "low IQ" he followed his fascinations into independent study to produce a number of revolutionary new combat theories. He never gave an inch, and so lived his entire career ostracised. He died forlorn, unsatisfied that he'd achieved his life's work.

<!-- His "Acolytes", however, continued to spread the word after his death. (From that point of view, I like to think he’s Christ-like. And if you read the book, you'll know this is the _only_ way he could ever be considered Christ-like). -->

His theories—Energy-Maneuverability theory, Destruction and Creation, and the OODA loop—are all now highly reputed across many domains, not just the military. But none would exist without Boyd’s extreme dedication to his own thoughts. He spent half a century standing his ground against the United States Military, perhaps the most rigid and demanding organisation in history.

Sheer _bloody-mindedness_ was the prerequisite to all his theories. As Coram phrased it: "Without a skunk fight, life was boring."

## Bloody-mindedness as creative fuel

Reflecting back on my thoughts about the prerequisites for creation—[Creativity starts with love and theft](https://callumflack.blog/writing-without-worry), where I postulate that being interested starts the whole thing off (that is, _love_) and _theft_ lights the creative act (blank canvases are hard, just steal something)—I ended by surmising that when the creative process becomes thick and difficult, your inital interest is what will keep you going (gotta love what you do, so to speak).

<!-- I used record collecting as the lens, so the article has a flavour of "artistry". -->

<!-- Boyd, however, wasn't artistic in the way we _commonly_ understand it (I'll argue for a redefinition of "art" soon), yet clearly his interest fueled his singular theories.  -->

I realised that within Boyd's story there was also another type of fuel I've missed: _he believed other people had it wrong_. When reading current theories of the time, he listened to his feelings, determined what he read _didn't feel right_ (even though he did not know how it wasn't right), and then he plainly _did not agree to agree_ with the common understanding of the time. He didn't let it slide. Extreme disagreement was The Mad Major's creative spark.

<!-- He had no problem being outspoken, and he no problem living tru to his thoughts. We know this because he was nick-named at various times The Mad Major and The Ghetto Colonel. -->

At this point, I'll mention the idea of _contrarianism_ that startup culture celebrates, and which I believe is a very fine idea, but as with any term that becomes incorporated into a cultural lingo that by definition is a shorthand reduction of terms, its meaning becomes diluted. So, sure, peg this post as about _contrariansim_, but then you may not take the time to read about Body's magnificent example of bloody-mindedness and you'll only know contrarianism as a theory rather than a practice. So _I'm telling you_ Boyd was bloody-minded, not contrarian.

## Revising the creative prerequisite flow

In my last post, I used this step flow to illustrate what precedes and ignites the creative process.

`Fan > Collector > Scene > Imitation > Creation`

Which I argued can be shortened to just:

`Love > Theft > Art`

In light of The Mad Major's life and works, we know that bloody-mindedness is an important part for fueling the process when _things don't feel right but you don't yet know why or how_. When the creative process becomes thick and difficult, for bureaucratic reasons or whatever, then love has to transmute into a finer-grain rendering known as _extreme diagreement_ or _bloody-mindedness_:

`Love > Bloody-mindedness`

The creative process has contextual triggers. In the end, however, it doesn't matter what the flow steps are that lead to creation. As Boyd said, you either "_do something or be somebody_".
