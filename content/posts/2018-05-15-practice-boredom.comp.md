title: Practice boredom
lede: Before you can generate new insights, you have to wander. How does one perform this wandering thing? Start by aimlessly doing nothing. In other words, practice boredom.

Today I want to describe _how to wander_, which is the first step in my "_[3 Ws](https://callumflack.blog/wander-wonder-wunder)_" maxim for generating new insights. It may be a very small idea, but nothing generative happens without it. And as an example of how easy it is to forget this crucial step, I've not mentioned it once in any previous post so far. Such is the way fathoming where and how beginnings begin.

I've introduced a number of conceptual aphorisms in the past month of this blog that I'm refering to in this post. Here's a quick refresh:

* In a previous post, I described two basic prerequisites that kickstart any creative process: "[_Creativity starts with love and theft_](https://callumflack.blog/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft)".
* I also described _how_ one might go about loving and thieving their way towards creativity, which I call the "_[3 Ws](https://callumflack.blog/wander-wonder-wunder)_":

`Wander > Wonder > Wunder`

So then. To wander, just _practise boredom_.

`Practice boredom`

There you go. That's it. Entirely.

It's _stupid simple_. It reminds me of Jon Kabat-Zinn saying "_where ever you go, there you are_". Or Sam Harris reminding me to "_simply return to the breathe_". It's _obvious_. And yet it's difficult to remember and it's difficult to put into practice.

As an aphorism, it's quite beautiful. It's a poster. It's a door mat. It's a stubby holder, a tote bag, a sticker. (There you go, I have to make this aphorism into a typographic thing). Beauty helps make things easier to remember (I'm going to argue soon for aesthetics as the primary mode of human comprehension).

<!-- And as an avid collector of beautiful things, I've now collected this aphorism on my fantastic self-publishing, access-anywhere machine, called a blog. -->

## To practise boredom, do nothing.

So, how does one _practice boredom_? Simply, one _does nothing_. That is, _avoid doing things_. Avoid the low-hanging fruit, like daily routines, todo lists, being productive, coveting goals, having a TV show to watch, or making dinner. Get some rest. Stare out the window. Stop talking. When you do this, you can suddenly find yourself remembering things past, and connecting them to things seen today. That's wonder: fascinating interlinked connections will appear like invisible hyenas laughing at you from their hiding place.

<!-- Ignore the finish line.  -->

I'll caution you to please not expect that your boring ideas will be amazing. Stop expecting things to happen. Stop. Just enjoy some boredom. Laugh back at the hyenas. A daemon will arise if it wishes.

<!-- In summary, how do you wander? _Practise boredom._ How do you become bored? _Do nothing_. -->
