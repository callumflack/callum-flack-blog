When I was a buying records like a maniac, I would go through the entire ebay 45s listings posted on that day, most days of the week. it was a ridiculous and time consuming habit. It was also quite fun.

I would tell myself that I had to "follow the tangents", to see where they lead. "Don't buy what the others are buying", I'd tell myself, referring to the scenius I'd eventually share my finds with, "because that's boring and it'll cost too much. I'll only get one new record instead of seven." Of course, I was just trying to outdo my fellow collectors in our little game.

As I seem to do here, I'm extending my thoughts on the previous post, [Rules for Record Collecting](https://callumflack.blog/rules-for-record-collecting), which can be summarised as simply _optimise for interesting_.

This little aphorism seems to subsume most of what I'm naturally drawn to do. But why? And how come it seems to be an update of "follow the tangents"? I thought I'd list a few in the long line of past substitutes for the _optimise for interesting_ dictum, to see what comes of it.

# Rephrasings of "optimise for interesting"

> Follow the tangents

As discussed above, I think this one's mine. Sounds like a Stereolab song title.

> Stay hungry, stay foolish

Big old favourite. This one's from the back cover of Stewart Brand's final _Whole Earth Catalogue_ ([check out that awesome use of the Windsor typeface](http://ailiangan.com/post/50201060795/the-origins-of-stay-hungry-stay-foolish)). Steve Jobs quoted it. It's good.

> Do what you love

Let's talk about context. Meaning can't happen when an idea, like this one, becomes diluted across a culture. The phrase can still work for you, but only if you can make your way through the entanglement of popular misinterpretation. And if you get through that thicket, don't expect to get paid for it for 10,000 hours.

<!-- Nobody values your innate Premium Mediocre Precious Snowflakeyness except your Mother. -->

<!-- The key is use the phrase to turn inward. Do a 180, hold your nerve. As some DJ once said, "When everyone's buying funk records, I'm buying Country". -->

> Escape competition through authenticity

A new version of the above, but as Peter Thiel or Naval Ravikant would phrase it. Sorry. It does work though. Visit an Aesop store to understand.

> Follow your bliss

Joseph Campbell's philosophy on life, which rose from his criticism that our passivity can be “the sin of inadvertence, of not being alert, not quite awake.” It's very similar to "love what you do", but here's where words matter: the idea of the sacred is somehow omnipresent in this phrasing.

<!-- Or, as The Harptones said, "[life is but a dream](https://youtu.be/9rHqV3YMTP8)".  -->

> To each his own zeal

I swear this was a phrase in my Mum's edition of a Rumi book. But I can't googlefoo it. It's basically a revision of Campbell's great line. I've remembered it for a long time.

> Chance favors the prepared

"In the fields of observation, chance favours only the prepared mind" was Louis Pasteur's originally translated quote. This one hints at the fuller dimensions of "obliquitity" — rather than hunting opportunities, instead practise _looking_ by travelling at a tempo to fully digest what you see. And thus, the opportunities will present themselves to you, because you learned to prepare for them.

I'll leave it there for now. Maybe I'll add more later if they come to mind. Please email me if have another.

# Learning how to see

All of these aphorisms are bound by a practice of seeing. That is, of developing an individual's unique abilities by, firstly, paying attention to what one was already paying attention to, and then spending "flow state" time cultivating your "finger tip feelings" for it.
