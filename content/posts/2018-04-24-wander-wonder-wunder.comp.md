title: Wander, wonder, wunder — a way to maximise for interestingness
lede: Creativity may also demand another type of creative fuel—extreme disagreement, or bloody-mindedness. John Boyd's character is the perfect example.

Yesterday I described [John Boyd's bloody-mindedness](https://callumflack.blog/john-boyds-bloody-mindedness) as the perfect example of extreme disagreement as a type of creative fuel, where _bloody-mindedness_ is a finer grained name for _love_, the first prerequisite of the creative process. 

And in the [post before that](https://callumflack.blog/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft) I described a flow step of prerequisites for the creative process. These things need to happen before you can create anything new: 

`Love > Theft > Art`

Today I wanted to very briefly describe a method for figuring out what you "love". That is, how can you figure out what interests you and how can one then proceed? 

So, here's a compressed framework to _maximise for interesting_ (I'll attribute this phrase to Taylor Pearson. Although I have it in my own notes from 2013, Mr. Pearson definitely popularised it):

`Wander > Wonder > Wunder`

Wunder as in [wunderkammer](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/272), a cabinet of curiosities. I [previously used the garden metaphor](https://callumflack.blog/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft) to describe _wunderkammer_: it's a place where one keeps their discoveries as a collection and allows them to bloom.

This roughly equates to:

`Boredom > Curiosity > Discovery`

…but I think the "3 Ws" step flow is far more _interesting_.

So, to find what you love, maximise for interesting: go wander, then wonder (look, look, look, see, see, see) and collect what you discover in a wunderkammer place.
