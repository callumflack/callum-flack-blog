Yesterday I described [John Boyd's bloody-mindedness](https://callumflack.blog/john-boyds-bloody-mindedness) as the perfect example of extreme disagreement as a type of creative fuel, where _bloody-mindedness_ is a finer grained name for _love_, [the first prerequisite of the creative process](https://callumflack.blog/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft). The second prerequisite is theft, because a blank canvas has too many possibilities. These things need to happen before you can create anything new:

`Love > Theft > Art`

Today I wanted to very briefly describe a framework for finding what you "love". That is, how can you find things that utterly fascinate and completely captures your attention, naturally drawing you into a flow state such that you have no sense of time passing? And how can one then proceed to cultivate this enjoyable state?

Here's my take for a compressed framework to _maximise for interesting_:

<!-- (I'll attribute this phrase to [Taylor Pearson](https://twitter.com/TaylorPearsonMe). Although I have it in my own notes from 2013, Mr. Pearson definitely popularised it): -->

`Wander > Wonder > Wunder`

I use "wunder" as shorthand for [_wunderkammer_](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/272), which translates from German as a "cabinet of curiosities". I [previously used the garden metaphor](https://callumflack.blog/creativity-starts-with-love-and-theft) to describe wunderkammer: it's a place where one keeps their discoveries as a collection and allows them to bloom.

It's worth translating my lingo here. These "3 Ws" roughly map to:

`Boredom > Curiosity > Discovery`

…but I think the "3 Ws" step flow is far more _interesting_.

In summary: to find what you love, maximise for interesting. Go _wander_. Stop and _wonder_. Collect what you discover in a _wunderkammer_ place.
