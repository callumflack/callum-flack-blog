My wife was offended when I ended yesterday's post with the mention of excrement hue. That immediately reminded me of two quotes I'd seen recently. So I made a "sembl doublequote" about the art of offence.

These "sembl doublequotes" are an idea from [Charles Cameron](http://zenpundit.com/?p=51353). If you follow that link, you'll see how beautiful and fascinating they can be?

Doublequotes are the simplest unit of the game "sembl". Again, Sembl is an idea by [Charles Cameron](https://twitter.com/hipbonegamer) based on Hesse’s Glass Bead Game novel. It's been made into a webapp by my friend Cath Styles. Here's how Charles describes Sembl as a whole spectrum of ways of thinking drawn from the bes:

> …we have assorted artists, creative types and eccentric thinkers who see sideways, think laterally, connect dots, listen with care, appreciate silences, hear multiple voices and hold them together in their minds like a symphony… These are the folks who have the best grasp of complex problems, the bridge-builders between parties and factions…

By creating a visual match of connected ideas, we can scupper language and logic, and get to access intuition and pattern-matching, to play a game of finding new connections and new understanding. Sembls depend "[on an open co-intention among all parties](http://sembl.net/sembl-thinking/)". Sounds like a scenius, doesn't it?

I've been practising "sembls" of late.
