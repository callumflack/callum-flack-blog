  "body": "<p>Hi, I’m Callum. I’m drawn to wonder. I use this blog as a practice space to reassemble the “things inbetween” that resonate with me. Often I won’t understand the reasons why they resonate until I write, draw or play around with them.</p>\n<p>I’m a designer by trade. I focus on digital design, working fluidly across visual design, user experience, and code. You can read more about the services I provide at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://callumflack.design\">Callum Flack Design</a>.</p>\n<p>I learned to code websites in 2010 so that I could gain more design control. This unexpectedly changed the way I viewed the world and transformed me into a constant learner.</p>\n<!-- Rough consensus and maximal interestingness -->\n<!-- I think (and design) mostly in words, but I remember things—like 45 record labels—mostly in colours and images. -->\n<p>I’ve lived in and worked around in London, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, all for five years or more. Since 2015, my wife, our young family and I have lived in <a class=\"icon-targetblan\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BXbsNdrAt-v\">Cairns, Australia</a>.</p>\n<!-- ## Locations -->\n<!-- Eventually, everything connects—people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se. — Charles Eames -->\n<!-- “While I was there, I was just gathering images and names, and ideas and rhythms, and I was storing all of these things … in my mind somewhere. And when it was time to sit down and write songs, when I reached into the attic to see what I was gonna write about, that’s what was there. I just felt a strong passion toward the discovery of going there, and it opened my eyes, and all my senses were overwhelmed by the feeling of that place. When I sat down to write songs, that’s all I could think of…” — Robbie Robertson’s writing process -->\n<p>In my spare time, I collect vinyl records from every diaspora of recorded music. Finding the uncommon on forgotten records is a lesson in noticing wonder that I take with me everywhere. Some people even know me for the series of annual soul 45 mixes I used to do, called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/coloronetear/\">The Way I See It</a>.</p>\n<p>Current maxim: <em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/callumflack/status/970509881034686465\">optimise for interesting</a></em>.</p>\n<!-- ## Why blog? -->\n<h2>Get in touch</h2>\n<p>callumflack at gmail dot com<br>\n<a class=\"icon-targetblank\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/callumflack\">Twitter</a><br>\n<a class=\"icon-targetblank\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/callumflack/\">Instagram</a><br></p>\n"
